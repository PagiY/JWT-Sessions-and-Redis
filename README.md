## ABOUT

### Exploring JWT and Sessions + Redis for user auth

#### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

* Stateless approach. No database required but client-side must save the token (via cookie or localStorage - not recommended).
* Good for server-server communications or microservices architecture.
* Uses the concept of refresh tokens, where an expired access token is secretly refreshed and given a new token without logging out the user.
* Refresh tokens can be stored in a database and must be encrypted (but it loses its statelessness)

#### Sessions

* Stateful approach. Authentication data should be stored in both the client and server side.
* Sessions can easily be invalidated.
* Sessions are generally recommended than JWT.
